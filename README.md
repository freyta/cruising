# Freyta's Cruise Scripts

These are a bunch of different cruising scripts I have made in Python and Javascript.

The Python scripts are designed to scrape the official website and print the data into a JSON file sorted by price per night.

The userscripts are designed to be used with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) and add functionality to a few different websites I use while searching for cruises.
